### There's some core DevOps principles and practices, which I encourage you to follow if you want to move an organization towards a DevOps transformation.

Over the past ten years I've been guided on my DevOps journey by the aim to improve development cycle of the products I've been working on, and the desire of continuous learning.

DevOps technics and patterns are widely explained in many posts, books and podcasts. In this post, I want to share some lessons I've learned in my DevOps journey.

## 1. Measure your development processes

Eficiency and removing waste are the two main objective key results that you pursue. If you want to improve your software delivery performance, it's important to thrive actions based on emphirical information. You should be able to measure the following metrics:

   **- Lead time for changes**: many companies are efficient on using their resources, but a really slow pace. This indicator gives you information on how fast you can bring new business requirements to production environment, and can help you to balance resource usage and flow.

   **- Deployment frequency**: this indicator it's highly correlater with batch sizes of your projects. As soon as you reduce batch sizing, it's less complex deploy in production and you will be able to deploy more frequently.

   **- Mean time to restore service**: average time need to recover your service from an incident like unplanned outage. This  time includes not only until you recover your service to customers, but also figure out the root cause and fix it in production environment.

By collecting this information you are assessing which is your starting point, and allows you to create the first backlog to improve your system. Every time you apply changes to your applications, tools or processes, you will be able to check if system is improved or not.

## 2. Show business value to managers

Regardless the size of the organization, you'll need funding to improve your toolchain, refactor applications, update processes or teach your employees. It's important to map your efforts to monetization, in terms of the improvement.

By improving key performance indicators listed in point 1, first beneficiary is business in terms of:

- If you improve your lead time, business will be able to deliver products to customers more quickly.

- By improving your frequency in deployment, this means your business will be able to deliver more frequently value to customers.

- If you improve your mean time to recover service, you can traduce it to better service given to customers.

## 3. Focus on a Learning culture in your organization

Work on culture organization is one of the most difficult challenges to be addressed. DevOps technics and practices are focused on improve speed, availability and cost reduction, and it's necessary everyone try to learn new approaches on how apply new technics, and try to experiment in their daily work. Create an innovation mindset, move people to continuously learn and be more open to change and try new techniques. When people embrace creativity, they are able to deliver smarter solutions for your business.

I focus the efforts on try to figure out which kind of context allows the creation of high-performance teams, and I found by working in this three points:

**Build a safety environment** where everyone is comfortable to work together. It's not an easy task, you must pick up trash and remove bad apples. Also is important focus your company in products supported with specific funding, rather than be focused in projects.

**Share vulnerability** by creating spaces where you can talk on what you've done thinking how to improve or change. Take out people from their confort zone at first is awkward, but has positive results.

**Establish purpose** which guide outcomes through your products and initiatives to align the entire organization.

## 4. Achieve big through small

It's not possible to transform an organitzation in short term. People need to learn step by step how to use new techniques and tools, and change their behaviors.

Innovation Curve of Rogers classify adopters and innovators into various categories, based on the idea that some people are more open to adapt to changes:

Innovation teams probably are the ones who are leading the DevOps transformation in your organization.

I should propose you to identify the early adopters teams in your organization to start your DevOps transformation. Check with early adopters teams your model and refine it.  KPIs and metrics collected should visualize the improvements, as well as how teams are comfortable and more productive while using theses tools. Overcommunicate all these results to the entire organization, and then expand devops model step by step throughout your company. Some team will like to adopt your organization's DevOps model in order to improve their lead time and development cost.

## 5. Your DevOps journey never ends

Once you've started your DevOps journey it will never end. Yes, continuously you can learn from your pipeline, improved defined workflow, fine tune using tools and receive feedback from your using the pipeline defined.
