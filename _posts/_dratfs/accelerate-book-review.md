### In this post I created a review based on my reading of Accelerate book, and my opinion about.

([Nicole Forsgren](https://nicolefv.com)), ([Jez Humble](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jez-humble)) and ([Gene Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/realgenekim)) decide to write this book, after years studying IT industry (they started in 2013). Through this book they explain to the world their conclusions, and which methods they had been using to get feedback from engineers all over the world.

This book, not only is written by the most influencers of DevOps movement, but also is reviewed and referenced by recognized people of IT industry like Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist for ThoughtWorks, and Courtney Kissler, Vice President of Global Technology for Nike.

Their journey starts running a worldwide study, asking about their habits or how people develop software. Year by year writters were iterating the questions to collect information, based on the conclusions extract from the results of previous years. You can find detailed results in the DevOps State Report in this ([link](https://itrevolution.com/devops-research/)).
