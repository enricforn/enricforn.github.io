### Easy reading where you will figure out how software development will move to the next step beyond DevOps

## All Tecnhologist Want To Move Forward

Since the word "DevOps" was coined in 2009 by Patrick Debois, more and more development teams start experimenting with devops practices, simplifying processes and transforming people's behaviour. Continue reading if you want to discover what's coming next to DevOps movement.

## What's Next Beyond DevOps

Yes DevOps, by automating software development lifecycle, turning infrastructure into code and measuring development performance has revolutionized software development. DevOps brings the technical agility to software development. Some development teams reached to an [Elite Performance](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf), which means they are able to satifsy business needs in a fast, efficient and reliable way.

But, do someone have discovered a new method for improve yet more development performance ? Is there new technologies or methodologies that would replace what we currently we are using ? Does Kubernetes, Terraform, Javascript or GO the new legacy ? What's next beyond DevOps ?

## DevOps becomes a Commodity

Many software development methodologies have been arised, everyone improving preceding ones (Waterfall, Agile , Kanban, ...). And each new methodology added or removed features, processes or practices which make easier to develop software aligned with business needs.

For example, take a look at the following table, it compares Waterfall and Agile methodologies:

|Feature|Waterfall|Agile|
|-------|---------|-----|
|Scope|All is required to be defined|Defining clearly the purpose, features are defined iteratively|
|Priorization|All or nothing|We start developing most valued features for our customer|
|Delivery|Unique delivery at the end of the execution|Continuously delivering software at each iteration|

In terms of technical software development, Developers start shitfting left most of validation processes, and Operations guys started writing script to make their day-to-day easier and faster. Development and Operation team have been collaborating even more closely to make it easier bringing applications and their infrastructure from development stages to production real world. Docker brings this collaboration to the next level: less comunication needed between Development and Operation teams.

By mastering in DevOps  we have learned to try and change our development processes, tools and technologies, and measure if that changes have a positive impact. We are now fearless to experiment with new techniques and technologies in a calculated risk environment. Therefore, when new technologies or processes appear, we will be able to experiment with them in our systems and validate if it improves our process. If those artifacts are better, then we will be there.

## CALMR to move beyond

CALMR is an acronym which define a set of principles to assess whether a company is ready to adopt DevOps practices, or how a company is moving forward in ther DevOps transformation.

### Culture 

Culture is the most important principle to work on to enable a DevOps transformation. A sense of shared responsability between teams is the first step. Needs the approval of management layer within the organization. Then break silos is the next step. An interesting kind of culture proposed in [Accelerate](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/) book is [Westrum Culture](https://cultooling.com/about/westrum). One of them most important keys is high cooperation between teams.

### Automation

Automate manual task is the principle which give more visibility to your DevOps transformation. But automation is challenging: you should rethink your process to turn it in an automated process, and trade-off: cost of maintaining the automation is worth ? is giving autonomy and speed to other teams ? Countinuous Integration automation enables artifact generation standarization, a we should implement it in our company making our developers' life easier.

### Lean 

By applying [Lean Principles](https://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/Principles.cfm) in your day to day, helps you and your team eliminate waste and optimize your value stream helps team to be more efficient.

### Measure 

As Peter Drucker said: "If you can't measure it, you can't manage it". We apply this principle to figure out if change we made in our processes, tools or behaviours have a positive or negative impact in our performance. By measuring the number of builds run in our continuous integration system, gives us information about the usage of our CI toolchain. Measuring the failure rate of builds run, can give us information regarding the quality of code, and if we apply changes to the build process is well understood by developers.

### Repeat

There's no finish line. You should always apply Plan Check Do Act to each principle. As people learn new process or tools, their creativity applied to your business probably will drive to more performance delivering software. Though, protect capacity to experiment, try new tools or processes and validate if they have positive or negative impact.


## Are you ready to go ?

Whether you or your company started your DevOps journey sometime ago, or you want to start it, apply CALMR principles. Insatiably iterate through each one, for sure you will figure out a way to have a positive impact in your development process.

You can continue working without making changes, but stay prepared to suffer the [Red Queen Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis). Red Queen Effect applied to software development, means that  while your competitors work in improve their development processes and gains in performance, you stay in the same level of efficiency. In the mid term you will be less efficient than others.
