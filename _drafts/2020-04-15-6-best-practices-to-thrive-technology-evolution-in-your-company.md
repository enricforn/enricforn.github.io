### If you are responsible for technology in your company, whether as CTO or middle-manager, this post will help you thrive the technology evolution inside your company. Either you work in a startup or a big organization, this post explain xx best practices to guide to the new technology paradigm.

## Committed Technology Manager

You are the kind of people how love learning cutting edge technologies, discuss with your peers about different use cases for using a tool (probably nowadays would be Terraform, GO, Python, ...), or how to use new development practices to improve your development lifecycle, such as XP, Agile, Lean or DevOps,... Everything is going right and you are having fun. You wanna go a step further, and next goal is benefit your company from your knowledge about technology. Therefore, you write an ideal roadmap which your company should invest to perform better at delivering software. Until here, everything is working fine. You've been working for many years in IT industry, starting from the grassroots. You catched the new vibes from the latest cutting edge technology trends. You are prepared to lead your company technology evolution. You truely believe that the company should provision budget for this program and run it to stay competitive.

## My Stakeholders do not understand my evolution roadmap

Your roadmap seems to be perfect, and it's completely aligned to the latest technology trends. You share the plan and the program to the development team. Although your plan is focused to development team, in order to improve their deliveries and make their life easier, they do not feel comfortable with your plan. Your roadmap suppose too much effort learning new tools, and changing processes, beyond the volume of business deliverables they have with current apps. They think your plan is great but is not feasible. You feel disappointed. You don't understand why developers want continue working in the same way, and with the same technology and tools.

But your nightmare doesn't ends here. When roadmap is exposed to your CEO, simple questions follow: "How much money this tranformation program will cost to the company ? Which is the estimated date to put it in production ?" And your mind the answers are: "The program will cost whatever it is worth, and we'll be using these enablers as soon as possible". You bite your tongue as you know they are not the right answers. TOP-Management must know the answer in these terms: COST and TIME.

## Others walked this way

In all the companies I've succeed running evolution projects, you must align different goals: delivering software, estimate ROI in terms of quality, cost or time to market, and assure development team has their life easier. Another point worth to be considered: get feedback from all stakeholders. Make sure these feedback get the answers to some of their problems in your roadmap.

## This Is The Plan

You can follow these practices to build a much more feasible roadmap:

- Get wives from all stakeholders:

    * TOP Management: your plan must give answer to their questions. Of course they want software a infrastructure with the latest technology, but they are responsible for many other aspects of the company. Each project in your program must contain a rational response of the benefits, and an approximate date of when it will be effective.

    * Business: this people live in the real world, using in production software system. It's important to know their experience, and try to improve it.

    * Development Team: they receive the pressure of business directly, they do not have time to innovate and learn new languages or techniques. Their aim is to build desired software for business in the expected time and cost. They want to focus in business, no matter which toolchain they use, neither the most advanced tooling nor scripting.

    * IT Industry: yes the easiest. As you like learning cutting edge technologies and experimenting with new software an techniques, you should choose the best which fits in your organization. 

- Detail constraints or restrictions inside your organization. Tools, frameworks or technology stuff, needs custom changes to fit in every organization. For example, operate a business under a regulatory environment requires compliance with certain rules. Know constraints and pains, will make easier identify risks in your projects, and include solutions in your roadmap which allow arising new interests to your stakeholders. By adopting new tools, techniques or languages, enable your stakeholders to learn new features to be added in their products, or changing the way they are doing something to an easier, less costly or time effort way.

- Include budget for enable the adoption. Consider certain amount of budget to help people learn using new tool, practices or frameworks. Otherwise they will not be able to start with your brand new stuff, and project will fail. Allocate bugdet for adoption will give the chance to the customers to validate new capacities and time to learn how to use them.

- I highly recommend the usage of [SMART Framework](https://thedigitalprojectmanager.com/project-objectives/) to define each project objective of the roadmap. They method will help you manager expectations of your stakeholders, and communicate your plan in plain language so everyone will understand what you want to do, and what can be achieved.

- Review your roadmap regularly. You should include a mechanism that allows you to adapt some point of projects' roadmap meanwhile they are being executed. I recommend you to include regularly milestones to deliver value (for example every two months). In these reviews you can readapt defined projects, or add/remove projects, and fit a continuous evolution roadmap of technology.

Let's take an example: you want to provide a platform were development team can easily deploy new container-based applications abstracting them from the complexity of build release and operation, a let them focusing on solve business needs. You consider launching at least theses projects in a program format:

- New [K8s](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster in [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) provisioned and operated with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

- Tooling based on [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) and [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/).

Adopting these technologies and tools not only implies installing them in your company, but also many teams in your organizations should change processes and behaviors.

I suggest you to use a tool to organize your technology evolution ([taskade](https://www.taskade.com/) is a great tool for this purpose), and build your roadmap applying explained best practices. Information included in this roadmap should give response to some of these questions:

- A common goal which all of your stakeholders are aligned. For example: improve Business Agility creating and delivering digital products and services.

- How much it will cost ? Although you can't accurately predict de cost, I should provide a High Level Estimation for execution these projects:

    · Time Material (consultancy, implementation, enablers, adoption).

    · Infrastructure.

    · Cost of maintenance in production (Licensing, Support Services, ...).

    · Any other cost concepts required for the projects.

- How you will measure your goal is achieved ?

    · Lead Time: time reduction of 20% converting a defined product to an operational product or service.

    · Mean Time To Recover Service: time reduction of 30% by detecting the root cause of an outage and put the fix in production.

- When we will be using these new platform and toolchain ? For each technology you should set the basic milestones every two months. Let see the example of Kubernetes:

    · Milestone 1: Kubernets up and running.

    · Milestone 2: Showcase application running in K8s.

    · Milestone 3: First production application running in K8s.

- Who will help to use this platform and tooling ? In this example should exist a platform team, which initially should also have the role of enablers, helping everyone to learn on how use this brand new platform.

## Takeaways

Aligning all involved stakeholders is critical to get the approval of your evolution roadmap.

Measure, review and give feedback constantly of the progress of each project, give visibility of work and give enough information to drive the roadmap to the correct direction.

Hope it helps in designing your own roadmap evolution.
