### Companies around the world increased the number of deployed apps by 9% in 2021, Okta study says. You would be interested in this post if you are concerned about how to accelerate or scale software development in your organization.

## Companies Create More And More Software

All types of companies regardless of their size are creating more software apps every day. Over the past four years deployed apps per customer have risen for a combined growth of 22%, based on analysis by [Okta Inc](https://www.okta.com/businesses-at-work/2021/#fastest-growing-apps). As software codebase grows in organizations, often implies an amount of the complexity of their systems. How can you deal with this complexity? How can you develop more software at the same pace or even faster? How do you rationalize your software and infrastructure?

In this post, you can figure out how to deal with this complexity and productively scale your ecosystem of tools through an Internal Developer Platform. 

## What Is An Internal Developer Platform (IDP) And Why I Need One

Internal Developer Platform is a set of tools, services and processes that supports and accelerate your software development and the management of its infrastructure. In your journey to an efficient software development process, often struggle with trying to find the right balance between the standardization of your applications and giving enough freedom to developers to customize the applications. IDP comes with standardization. For example, if a developer starts creating a new application, instead of creating a repo in the SCM, assigning permissions to all contributors, and creating a ticket to the infrastructure team to deploy the application, we can develop a plugin in our preferred IDE or a web application that based on an application name, technology stack and traffic load requirements, automatically register our new application in our Application Portfolio Catalog.

## Win To Win For Everyone

Some of the advantages listed below have a close relationship. Let's detail the most important advantages of using or start implementing an IDP:

### **1. Alignment**

Through and IDP is explicitly implemented which kind of infrastructure you can deploy and which types of applications are supported. The offering is well-defined. Everyone knows the expectations of the system. Detail documentation on how each tool or integration works is crucial, to show transparency about the development process.

### **2. Compliance and Governance**

Having your development process implemented throughout an ecosystem of tools allows you to drive software development to satisfy some requirements. For example, from a software development lifecycle perspective, avoid anti-patterns implemented by analyzing code statically. From the infrastructure perspective, by implementing an IDP, you can automate the provisioning of the resources needed, and assure that the platform is hardened and secure.
You can store information regarding your data, applications, 

### **3. Focus development teams on business value**

And IDP brings self-service features by automating tasks, thus your development teams do not have to worry about how that. For example, imagine that we implement a feature in our IDP in which you type a name of the application, and a name for 3 components of each (a React SPA, an NPM component and a web service implemented in Rust). By introducing this information to the IDP, you can automate the following tasks:
 * Automatically provision a group with some repositories in your SCM.
 * Create three repositories for each component and assign a pipeline to each repo as a webhook.
 * Apply a default template to the project.
 * Allocate resources to the development and production environment to allow the deployment of the application.

Usability of toolchain smooth the path of using your ecosystem of tools, and spend just minutes to click on the right options to allocate resources needed.

### **4. Autonomy**

Developers have all the tools they need and are easily accessible to do the required job in the expected timeline. IDP also enables to centralize teams interactions inside the platform, liberate team members dealing ticketing tools with different workflows to interact with other teams. If I need to create a new application required for the business needs, I simply access to the IDP and I'm able to provision de resources needed.

### **5. Efficiency

Autonomy in software development increases speed and reduces the cost of interacting with other teams in your organization. Your IDP must integrate a set of tools which allows using this ecosystem fast. And you must measured how faster is development, not only for improve your IDP, but also to help development teams to improve the quality of their products and processes.

## Start Building Your IDP Now

The implementation of this kind of ecosystem needs to be tailored to each organization. Start delivering small changes which benefits development teams in their daily work:
 1. Identify in your software development process actions to automate or integrations between tools developer's daily work.
 2. Validate if there's any open source tool that fix this gap, probably other team had this problem before. Take a loot at [CNCF Clout Native Interactive Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/), there's a bunch of useful tools.
 3. Integrate this new product whether is built or bought as smooth as possible to thee development lifecycle.
 4. Measure the impact in terms of development performance ([How to measure your development process](https://enricforn.github.io/devops/2019/08/09/five-lessons-learned-from-devops-journey/#1-measure-your-development-process)), and share results with all stakeholders (Developers, Product Managers, C-Level).
 5. Repeat process.

You can also consider to contact to companies experts in this field like [Humanitec](https://humanitec.com/) or [Shipa](https://shipa.io/), which has built great SaaS products.
