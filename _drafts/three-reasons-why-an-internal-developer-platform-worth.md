Since the word "DevOps" was coined in 2009 by Patrick Debois, more and more development teams start experimenting with devops practices, 

A character: The customer is always the hero of the story, not the brand. It’s up to UX designers to figure out what customers want from the brand, usually through UX research and user testing. They need to focus on the desires that drive people, things like conserving financial resources, saving time, building social networks, or gaining status.
Has a problem: The villain in the StoryBrand arc is the character’s problem. It’s useful to personify that problem and understand that the company’s products are like weapons the customer can use to defeat it. Companies tend to focus on solving external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems. People have three levels of conflict:
- External (most businesses try to solve external problems)
- Internal (such as frustration, intimidation, insecurity)
- Philosophical (why does this story matter?)
And meets a guide: The guide is the business or brand. Customers need someone to take care of the problem. Their perception of the brand will be crucial to their trust. Two things must be communicated:
- Empathy (show an understanding of the pain the customer may feel)
- Authority (it will give the customer confidence that the brand is able to help them)
Who gives them a plan: The business shows the customer what they need to do next. Customers are still not sure whether to buy until shown a simple plan of action. UX designers can spell out the exact next steps for customers. They can also alleviate any anxiety the customer may have by addressing concerns related to the product or service.
And calls them to action: Effective calls to action facilitate purchases or signups.
That helps them avoid failure: What is at stake for the customer? What will they lose if they don’t buy from this brand?
And ends in a success: Tell customers how this specific action can change their life. Show them what their lives will look like after they buy the product and how that resolution will make them feel. Three solid ways storytellers end a story is by allowing the character to:
- Win power or position
- Find somebody or something that makes them whole
- Experience some form of self-realization that also makes them whole
