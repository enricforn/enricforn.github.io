<p>Amazon Web Services is a great cloud environment. Personnally Iâ€™m using its S3 service (<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html">Simple Storage Service</a>) to backup all my information. Itâ€™s really cheap and easy to access.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/es/cli/">AWSCli</a> to interact with amazon web services. Most of actions you can do with their web console, can also be run from awscli.</p>

<p>I just downloaded the application and installed it. Apparently is very easy, the install application is an easy wizard. After that, I opened a powershell console and configure a default credentials to access to my AWS account:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Open powershell console (powershell.exe).</li>
  <li>Run command â€˜aws configureâ€™. This command ask you credentials to access to AWS:
    <ul>
      <li>Access Key Id: This key</li>
      <li>Secret Access Key: Key showed only when you create the user.</li>
      <li>Default Region: in my case eu-west-1</li>
      <li>Default output format: I chose json</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It seems everything works fine, but when I ran the next command (aws s3 cp s://mybucket D:\data\mybucket.) the following error appears:</p>

<p>C:\Program Files\Amazon\AWSCLI.\dateutil\parser.py:336: UnicodeWarning: Unicode  equal comparison failed to convert both arguments to Unicode - interpreting them as being unequal</p>

<p>This is an error with python 2.7.9 version, which was solved in earlier versions of python. And this is the python version that awscli installs to run properly.</p>

<p>You can run command â€˜aws â€“versionâ€™ to know which version of python is using your installed awscli:</p>

<p>PS C:\Users\enric&gt; aws â€“version
aws-cli/1.11.38 Python/2.7.9 Windows/10 botocore/1.5.1</p>

<p>Trying to solve this issue, I started to find a solution in google. And I found an opened issue in <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/424">github awscli</a>. I hope AWS guys will solve it in the next version :). There I found the workaround to solve this issue:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Uninstall AWSCli from my machine.</li>
  <li>Install the latest version of python.</li>
  <li>Install awscli from python 3 installer: open a powershell console. Run commmand â€˜pip install awscliâ€™.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, the awscli installed on my machine, is using a newer version of python and works fine:</p>

<p>PS C:\Users\enric&gt; aws â€“version
aws-cli/1.11.38 Python/3.6.0 Windows/10 botocore/1.5.1</p>

<p>If you encounter the same issue, hope this helps.</p>
